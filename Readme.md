# ðŸ“± Mobile Price Predictor

### **Tech Stack**
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Streamlit, NumPy, Pickle

---

## ðŸ§  Project Overview
Developed an interactive **machine learning web application** to predict smartphone prices based on key technical specifications such as brand, processor, RAM, storage, battery capacity, and 5G support.

---

## ðŸš€ Key Highlights
- Built an **end-to-end regression pipeline** integrating data preprocessing, feature transformation, scaling, and model training using **ColumnTransformer**, **RobustScaler**, and **BaggingRegressor (XGBoost base estimator)**.  
- Implemented **automated feature encoding** (OneHot and Ordinal) and **missing value imputation** to enhance model robustness.  
- Achieved high prediction accuracy through **cross-validation** and **ensemble learning** techniques.  
- Designed a **Streamlit-based user interface** for real-time price prediction and dynamic result visualization.  
- Serialized the final pipeline using **Pickle** for model deployment and scalability.  
- Leveraged statistical estimation to compute and display **confidence intervals** for predicted price ranges.
